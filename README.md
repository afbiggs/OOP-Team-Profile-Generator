  # OOP Team Profile Generator
  
  ## Description
  
  * The Team Profile Generator is a command-line-input application which is ran using NodeJS. Once initiated, the application requests information from the user about members of an engineering team and generates a HTML file displaying the information the user input. The HTML file can then be ran in a web browser where the information the user gave will be displayed in an easy to read format.  

*Video walkthrough of how to initiate and run the application:* https://app.castify.com/view/7673e1b3-c38b-4a0d-89f3-de43247e4383
